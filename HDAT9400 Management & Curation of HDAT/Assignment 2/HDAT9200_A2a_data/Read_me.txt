The data dictionary provides a comprehensive overview of the variables and their characteristics in two datasets: assignmt2a_gp_data and assignmt2a_ed_data. These datasets contain information about the people and services in a fictitious neighborhood called Sunnydale, which has a high proportion of culturally and linguistically diverse populations.

The assignmt2a_gp_data dataset represents the client information recorded in the most recent general practice (GP) visits in 2014. It includes variables such as unique person ID, date of the most recent GP visit, age, gender, country of birth, healthcare card status, smoking history, alcohol consumption, blood pressure readings, and reason for the GP visit. The dataset consists of 5837 rows and 17 columns.

The assignmt2a_ed_data dataset contains information about emergency department (ED) attendances by Sunnydale residents. It includes variables such as unique person ID, dates of ED presentation and separation, age at ED presentation, gender, country of birth, interpreter requirement, private health insurance status, triage category, principal presenting diagnosis, additional diagnoses, and separation mode. This dataset consists of 63614 rows and 15 columns.

The data dictionaries provide detailed descriptions of each variable, including their data types, formats, and allowable entries for categorical variables. They also specify any relevant formats or codes used in the datasets. Hope the data dictionaries serve as a valuable reference guide and help the utilization and understanding of the GP and ED datasets in the context of the Sunnydale neighborhood.

some suggestions about formats and document contants
    1.data dictionary, cleaning notes, flowcharts need to be separate files
    2.Data dictionaries could be several tables, containing raw data dictionary and cleaned data dictionary (updated)
    3.put a read_me file into the folder as a brief introduction
    4.


some suggestions about data cleaning
    1.would be better to remove/clean the missing data (e.g. in GP data, 28 GP_last missing also miss all the rest information)
    2.the Summary statistics as the first step of data cleaning (add n nmiss into codes)
    3.In GP data, age_stop has age and year (1969 - 2014), year need change into age (please note: data created on Oct 8, 2021, 3:32:28 PM)
    
    4.

    /* Calculate age from birth year */
data mydata.age_data;
   set mydata.birth_year_data;
   age = 2021 - birth_year; /* Calculate the age by subtracting birth year from the current year */
run;
