# HDAT9800 2024 Chapter 3 optional unmarked exercise

This optional, unmarked exercise is intended to help you practice and self-assess your understanding of the core curriculum material in the HDAT9800 course. It is optional, and is unmarked. However, you may wish to seek help or feedback from your course instructors if you do attempt the exercise and are unsure about any aspects of it. Please see the instructions on the [Optional Unmarked Exercises page](https://hdat9800.cbdrh.med.unsw.edu.au/optional_unmarked_exercises.html) for seeking feedback.

Your task is to create a simple report as an Rmarkdown document using _knitr_
that includes some _ggplot_ output.

The skeleton has been created for you.

You will be looking at the `ChickWeight` dataset from the _datasets_ package,
drawing some plots and answering a couple of questions.

Fill out the skeleton _chapter-3-exercise.Rmd_ in the exercise project,
commit your changes and push back to _GitHub._

Feel free to store the plot in a variable and build it up gradually
rather than repeat all the code each time.

See the code in the worked example towards the end of the _learnr_ tutorial for Chapter 3  for clues if you are unsure how to proceed.

Commit the Rmd file for the report to the exercise git repository and push the repository back to GitHub.
