# HDAT9800 2024 Chapter 4 optional unmarked exercise

This optional, unmarked exercise is intended to help you practice and self-assess your understanding of the core curriculum material in the HDAT9800 course. It is optional, and is unmarked. However, you may wish to seek help or feedback from your course instructors if you do attempt the exercise and are unsure about any aspects of it. Please see the instructions on the [Optional Unmarked Exercises page](https://hdat9800.cbdrh.med.unsw.edu.au/optional_unmarked_exercises.html) for seeking feedback.

Open the chapter-4-exercise.Rmd document, and record your answers in the places shown in the document. Please keep your responses fairly brief, no more than 10 lines at the most for each answer, and 4 or 5 lines is sufficient.

You may need to re-watch the pre-recorded lecture for Chapter 4 to answer the questions, or at least to get some clues on what we are looking for.

Once you have added your answers, knit the document to check that it looks OK, adjust if necessary, then commit your changes and push back to _GitHub._
