By suppressing the viral load and boosting the immune system, ART improves the quality of life for patients, helps control drug resistance, and tailors treatment strategies to individual needs. In this way, ART has been instrumental in turning HIV from a life-threatening condition into a manageable chronic illness for millions of people worldwide.\n","\n","However, optimising ART regimens is a complex challenge. Each patient’s response to treatment can vary depending on numerous factors, such as their baseline viral load, CD4 count, and the combination of medications they receive. This is where data science plays a crucial role: by analysing patient data, we can uncover insights that improve treatment outcomes, drive innovations in therapy design, and support public health policies.\n","\n","In this assignment, students are expected to harness the power of **machine learning algorithms** to analyse and predict patient outcomes based on their ART regimens and health indicators. By doing so, you'll not only engage with real-world clinical data but also learn how to apply advanced predictive modeling techniques that can ultimately enhance the way we understand and manage HIV.\n","\n","As we work through this dataset, you'll apply various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends that influence treatment success. By the end of this assignment, you'll have a stronger grasp of how machine learning can be used to make data-driven decisions in clinical settings, particularly in managing chronic diseases like HIV.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Kdd5vJjWJ5PA"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"7EJ-FT4tJy-A"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"QSYM7PdaKAvW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Bhgg9RNVKAxn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Pre-processing Code: Important Instructions\n","\n","In this assignment, you are provided with a pre-processing script that will prepare the dataset for analysis.

For **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)** in HIV management, a critical question is whether, by analysing a patient's early information (data from the first 3 timesteps), we can accurately predict their health status at a future point (i.e., at the 59th timestep).\n","\n","In this assignment, we aim to predict whether the viral load (VL) at the 59th timestep is below 200 using the early information of a patient. Viral load ≤ 200 is a critical clinical indicator of **viral suppression**, a key goal of ART in HIV treatment. Knowing whether viral load will be suppressed in the future helps inform treatment adjustments and patient care.\n","\n","To achieve this, we will use a **3-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**. The input to the MLP will include all features across the initial 3 timesteps (0, 1, 2), and the target will be predicting whether the viral load at the 59th timestep is less than or equal to 200.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","\n","For this question, we do **not** expect you to code everything from scratch. Instead, we have provided a **working example** of the required steps. Your task is to read and understand the code.\n","\n","Whenever you see the following:\n","\n","```python\n","#-----------------------------------------\n","# [Your answer here:]\n","# (WRITE HERE)\n","#-----------------------------------------\n","```\n","We expect you to write your understanding or explanation in the space marked as **(WRITE HERE)**. Make sure to comment your answers with a `#` to ensure the code still runs correctly.\n","\n","Your comprehension will be tested on the following topics:\n","\n","1. **Data Preprocessing**: Understanding how the input data is prepared, reshaped, and standardised.\n","2. **MLP Backbone Network Definition**: Comprehending how the MLP layers are defined and what their roles are.\n","3. **Training the Model**: Recognising the steps in the training loop, including forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation.\n","\n","## Why This is Important\n","\n","Predicting future viral load is crucial in managing HIV. Clinicians rely on viral suppression (VL ≤ 200) to gauge the effectiveness of ART. Being able to predict this based on early patient information helps adjust treatments proactively, improving patient outcomes.\n","\n","Now, proceed to the provided code example and fill in the explanation wherever prompted. Understanding each step in this process will enhance your ability to read, understand, and eventually build complex models for clinical data prediction tasks.\n","\n","Good luck!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2x7NvY7wOr0K"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Assignment Marks Breakdown (Total: 10 Marks)\n","\n","This question is worth **10 marks** and is divided into the following sections:\n","\n","1. **Data Preprocessing**: Understanding how the input data is prepared, reshaped, and standardised.\n","   - There are **6 specific places** where students are expected to comment on the code.\n","   - Each valid and correct comment is awarded **1 mark**, resulting in a total of **6 marks** for this section.\n","\n","2. **MLP Backbone Network Definition**: Comprehending how the MLP layers are defined and what their roles are.\n","   - There are **2 specific places** where students are expected to comment on the code.\n","   - Each valid and correct comment is awarded **1 mark**, resulting in a total of **2 marks** for this section.\n","\n","3. **Training the Model**: Recognising the steps in the training loop, including forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation.\n","   - There are **2 specific places** where students are expected to comment on the code.\n","   - Each valid and correct comment is awarded **1 mark**, resulting in a total of **2 marks** for this section.\n","\n","Thus, the total marks breakdown is as follows:  \n","**6 marks** for Data Preprocessing + **2 marks** for MLP Backbone Network Definition + **2 marks** for Training the Model = **10 Marks** in total.\n","\n","### Important Notice:\n","\n","It is expected that some of the required comments may not be immediately straightforward or directly obvious to the students.
